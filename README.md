# Image Caption Generator Model
- So, to make our image caption generator model, we will be merging these architectures. It is also called a CNN-RNN model.

- CNN is used for extracting features from the image. We will use the pre-trained model Xception.
- LSTM will use the information from CNN to help generate a description of the image.


# Project File Structure

Downloaded from dataset:

- Flicker8k_Dataset – Dataset folder which contains 8091 images.
- Flickr_8k_text – Dataset folder which contains text files and captions of images.
- The below files will be created by us while making the project.
